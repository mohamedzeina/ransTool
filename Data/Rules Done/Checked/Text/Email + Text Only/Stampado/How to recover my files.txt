All your files have been encrypted!

All your documents (databases, texts, images, videos, musics etc.) were encrypted. The encryption was done using a secret key 
that is now on our servers.

To decrypt your files you will need to buy the secret key from us. We are the only on the world who can provide this for you.

Note that every 6 hours, a random file is permanently deleted. The faster you are, the less files you will lose.

Also, in 96 hours, the key will be permanently deleted and there will be no way of recovering your files.

What can I do?

Contact us by email telling your ID (below) and wait for us to send the instructions.

As a proof, you can send one encrypted file, so we will send it back decrypted. Use it as a guarantee that we can decrypt your files.
