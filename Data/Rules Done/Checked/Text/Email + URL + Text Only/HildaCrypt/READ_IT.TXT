---+ HILDACRYPT v1.0 +---

All the files on this computer have been encrypted with a RSA-4096 + AES-256
cryptographic combination. These algorithims are used by the NSA and other
top tier organisations.

Backups were encrypted, and shadow copies were removed. So F8 or any other
methods may damage encrypted data and make it unrecoverable.

We exclusively have decryption software for your situation.
More than a year ago, world experts have recognized the impossibility of
decrypting by any means without the original decryptor.
NO decryption software is available to the public.
Antivirus companies, researchers, IT specialists, and no one else can help
you recover your data.

DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN - file may be damaged.
DO NOT DELETE readme files.
DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME the encrypted files.
This may lead to the impossibility of your files being recovered.

To confirm our honest intentions, send us 2 different files and you well get
them decrypted. They must not contain any sensitive information and must not
be archived.

To get info (decrypt your files) contact us at:

You well receive a BTC address for payment in the reply letter.
